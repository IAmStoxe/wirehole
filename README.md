## What is this?
WireHole is a combination of WireGuard, PiHole, and Unbound in a docker-compose project with the intent of enabling users to quickly and easily create and deploy a personally managed full or split-tunnel WireGuard VPN with ad blocking capabilities (via Pihole), and DNS caching with additional privacy options (via Unbound).

### Supported Architectures

The Wireguard image supports multiple architectures such as `x86-64`, `arm64` and `armhf`. Linuxserver - who makes the wireguard image we use - utilises the docker manifest for multi-platform awareness. 

More information is available from docker [here](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md#manifest-list) and LinuxServer's announcement [here](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/02/21/the-lsio-pipeline-project/).

Simply pulling `linuxserver/wireguard` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags 

> *This is the default configuration in this project*

**The architectures supported by this image are:**

| Architecture | Tag |
| :----: | --- |
| x86-64 | amd64-latest |
| arm64 | arm64v8-latest |
| armhf | arm32v7-latest |

## Recommended configuration / Split tunnel:

Modify your wireguard client `AllowedIps` to `10.2.0.0/24` to only tunnel the web panel and DNS traffic.

---

## Access PiHole

While connected to WireGuard, navigate to http://10.2.0.100/admin

*The password (unless you set it in `docker-compose.yml`) is blank.*

## Configuring for Dynamic DNS (DDNS)
If you're using a dynamic DNS provider, you can edit `docker-compose.yml` under "wireguard". 
Here is an excerpt from the file. 

You need to uncomment `#- SERVERURL` so it reads `- SERVERURL` without the `#` and then change `my.ddns.net` to your DDNS URL.

```yaml
wireguard:
   # ...
    environment:
      # ...
      - SERVERURL=my.ddns.net #optional - For use with DDNS (Uncomment to use)
      # ...
 # ...
```

---
## Configuring / Parameters

Container images are configured using parameters passed at runtime (such as those above). These parameters are separated by a colon and indicate `<external>:<internal>` respectively. For example, `-p 8080:80` would expose port `80` from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port `8080` outside the container.

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-p 51820/udp` | wireguard port |
| `-e PUID=1000` | for UserID - see below for explanation |
| `-e PGID=1000` | for GroupID - see below for explanation |
| `-e TZ=Europe/London` | Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London |
| `-e SERVERURL=wireguard.domain.com` | External IP or domain name for docker host. Used in server mode. If set to `auto`, the container will try to determine and set the external IP automatically |
| `-e SERVERPORT=51820` | External port for docker host. Used in server mode. |
| `-e PEERS=1` | Number of peers to create confs for. Required for server mode. Can be a list of names too: myPC,myPhone,myTablet... |
| `-e PEERDNS=auto` | DNS server set in peer/client configs (can be set as `8.8.8.8`). Used in server mode. Defaults to `auto`, which uses wireguard docker host's DNS via included CoreDNS forward. |
| `-e INTERNAL_SUBNET=10.13.13.0` | Internal subnet for the wireguard and server and peers (only change if it clashes). Used in server mode. |
| `-e ALLOWEDIPS=0.0.0.0/0` | The IPs/Ranges that the peers will be able to reach using the VPN connection. If not specified the default value is: '0.0.0.0/0, ::0/0' This will cause ALL traffic to route through the VPN, if you want split tunneling, set this to only the IPs you would like to use the tunnel AND the ip of the server's WG ip, such as 10.13.13.1. |
| `-v /config` | Contains all relevant configuration files. |
| `-v /lib/modules` | Maps host's modules folder. |
| `--sysctl=` | Required for client mode. |

### Environment variables from files (Docker secrets)

You can set any environment variable from a file by using a special prepend `FILE__`.

As an example:

```bash
-e FILE__PASSWORD=/run/secrets/mysecretpassword
```

Will set the environment variable `PASSWORD` based on the contents of the `/run/secrets/mysecretpassword` file.

### Umask for running applications

There is the ability to override the default umask settings for services started within the containers using the optional `-e UMASK=022` setting.
Keep in mind umask is not chmod it subtracts from permissions based on it's value it does not add. Please read up [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umask) before asking for support.

### User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, this is avoided by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```bash
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```

---

## Adding Clients
If the environment variable `PEERS` is set to a number or a list of strings separated by comma, the container will run in server mode and the necessary server and peer/client confs will be generated. The peer/client config qr codes will be output in the docker log. They will also be saved in text and png format under `/config/peerX` in case `PEERS` is a variable and an integer or `/config/peer_X` in case a list of names was provided instead of an integer.

Variables `SERVERURL`, `SERVERPORT`, `INTERNAL_SUBNET` and `PEERDNS` are optional variables used for server mode. Any changes to these environment variables will trigger regeneration of server and peer confs. Peer/client confs will be recreated with existing private/public keys. Delete the peer folders for the keys to be recreated along with the confs.

To add more peers/clients later on, you increment the `PEERS` environment variable or add more elements to the list and recreate the container.

To display the QR codes of active peers again, you can use the following command and list the peer numbers as arguments: `docker exec -it wireguard /app/show-peer 1 4 5` or `docker exec -it wireguard /app/show-peer myPC myPhone myTablet` (Keep in mind that the QR codes are also stored as PNGs in the config folder).

The templates used for server and peer confs are saved under `/config/templates`. Advanced users can modify these templates and force conf generation by deleting `/config/wg0.conf` and restarting the container.

## Modifying the upstream DNS provider for Unbound
If you choose to not use Cloudflare any reason you are able to modify the upstream DNS provider in `unbound.conf`.

Search for `forward-zone` and modify the IP addresses for your chosen DNS provider.

>**NOTE:** The anything after `#` is a comment on the line. 
What this means is it is just there to tell you which DNS provider you put there. It is for you to be able to reference later. I recommend updating this if you change your DNS provider from the default values.


```yaml
forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 1.1.1.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-addr: 1.0.0.1@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-addr: 2606:4700:4700::1111@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-addr: 2606:4700:4700::1001@853#cloudflare-dns.com
        forward-tls-upstream: yes
```

## Available DNS Providers

While you can actually use any upstream provider you want, the team over at pi-hole.net provide a fantastic break down along with all needed information of some of the more popular providers here:
https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/upstream-dns-providers/

Providers they have the information for:

1. Google
2. OpenDNS
3. Level3
4. Comodo
5. DNS.WATCH
6. Quad9
7. CloudFlare DNS
8. Custom

> With custom, you'll choose your favorite DNS provider. If you care about Internet independence and privacy, we suggest having a look at the [OpenNIC DNS Project](https://servers.opennic.org/).

Please add your custom DNS provider(s) in your customized `[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml#L68)` as an [Optional Variable](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/blob/master/README.md#optional-variables) or directly in Pi-hole's `setupVars.conf` with an example of NextDNS.io resolvers for IPv4 and IPv6:
```
PIHOLE_DNS_1=45.90.28.39
PIHOLE_DNS_2=45.90.30.39
PIHOLE_DNS_3=2a07:a8c0::75:86b2
PIHOLE_DNS_4=2a07:a8c1::75:86b2
```

If you are also caring for **performance and reliability** of the DNS provider you choose, you might be interested in [dnsping_rrd](https://github.com/thomasmerz/dnsping_rrd) which monitors the average response times of DNS resolvers in RRD databases and simple HTML pages with PNG graphs. After some days you will have a solid base for choosing the fastest and most reliable for your internet connection.

## Setting a DNS record for pihole
1. Login to pihole admin
2. Navigate to "Local Records"
3. Fill out the form like the image below
![Image](https://i.imgur.com/PM1kwcf.png)

Provided your DNS is properly configured on the device you're using, and you're connected to WireGuard, you can now navigate to http://pi.hole/admin and it should take you right to the pihole admin interface.

## Support Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it wireguard /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f wireguard`
* container version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' wireguard`
* image version number
  * `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' ghcr.io/linuxserver/wireguard`

---

## Updating Info

LinuxServer images are generally static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app inside. 
> **Note:** Updating apps inside the container is NOT supported.

Below are the instructions for updating **containers**:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull wireguard`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d wireguard`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Watchtower auto-updater (only use if you don't remember the original parameters)

* Pull the latest image at its tag and replace it with the same env variables in one run:

  ```bash
  docker run --rm \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  containrrr/watchtower \
  --run-once wireguard
  ```

* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

> **Note:** Watchtower is not endorsed as a solution for automated updates of existing Docker containers. In fact generally automated updates are discouraged. However, this is a useful tool for one-time manual updates of containers where you have forgotten the original parameters. In the long term, LinuxServer.io highly recommends using Docker Compose.

## FAQ

### How do you add client configurations?
If the environment variable `PEERS` is set to a number, the container will run in server mode and the necessary server and peer/client confs will be generated. The peer/client config qr codes will be output in the docker log. They will also be saved in text and png format under /config/peerX.

Variables `SERVERURL`, `SERVERPORT`, `INTERNAL_SUBNET` and `PEERDNS` are optional variables used for server mode. Any changes to these environment variables will trigger regeneration of server and peer confs. Peer/client confs will be recreated with existing private/public keys. Delete the peer folders for the keys to be recreated along with the confs.

To add more peers/clients later on, you increment the `PEERS` environment variable and recreate the container.

To display the QR codes of active peers again, you can use the following command and list the peer numbers as arguments: `docker-compose exec wireguard /app/show-peer 1 4 5` will show peers #1 #4 and #5 (Keep in mind that the QR codes are also stored as PNGs in the config folder).

The templates used for server and peer confs are saved under /config/templates. Advanced users can modify these templates and force conf generation by deleting /config/wg0.conf and restarting the container.

### Can I build ARM variants on x86_64?

The ARM variants can be built on x86_64 hardware using `multiarch/qemu-user-static`

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register --reset
```

Once registered you can define the dockerfile to use with `-f Dockerfile.aarch64`.

## Networking Considerations

If you plan to use Wireguard both remotely and locally, say on your mobile phone, you will need to consider routing. Most firewalls will not route ports forwarded on your WAN interface correctly to the LAN out of the box. This means that when you return home, even though you can see the Wireguard server, the return packets will probably get lost.

This is not a Wireguard specific issue and the two generally accepted solutions are NAT reflection (setting your edge router/firewall up in such a way as it translates internal packets correctly) or split horizon DNS (setting your internal DNS to return the private rather than public IP when connecting locally).

Both of these approaches have positives and negatives however their setup is out of scope for this document as everyone's network layout and equipment will be different.
